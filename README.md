## Softwares I used:
### [Rainmeter](https://www.rainmeter.net/)
I used Rainmeter to add additional systems information like the _CPU_, _RAM_, and _SSD_. I also added _Uplaad speed_ and _Download speed_ information, but this is highly customizable, you can add any skin that you'd like. To discover skins that you can use, you can visit this [link](https://www.rainmeter.net/discover/).

For the skin I used, you can visit this [link](https://www.deviantart.com/apexxx-sensei/art/Robik-771914763). 

### Powertoys
To search for software/application, files, folders, etc. Shorcut `ALT` + `Space bar`



### TranslucentTB
I've set my taskbar to "Automatically hide the taskbar", so you couldn't see the effect from the screeshot above. But what TranslucentTB basically doing here is just making the Windows taskbar transparent. You can install it from Microsoft Store 

### Wallpaper 
You can find the wallpaper I used here: [wallpaper](https://ph.pinterest.com/pin/584975439131176050/) 

### Why?
tired of the default look of Windows, so I decided to customize to have a different look than default appearance. However, itâ€™s still nowhere near the level of customization that others achieve using [Linux](https://www.reddit.com/r/unixporn/comments/1h3xnao/hyprland_comfy_catppucin_rice_for_uni/#lightbox). linux soon
